# SparXSS

## A JS Script For Redirection And Custom Javascript Execution For The SPARKvue XSS Vulnerability Found By ohonbob

The If Statement In The First Line Was Because It Would Execute Multiple Times While I Was Testing It

You Can Also Use The SparXSS.spklab File And Select 'Open Saved Experiment' When You Open The App

# ToDo
- ~~Make Icon's Show up for Every URL~~
- Make the custom URL's stay when you export the .spklab file (close to getting this working)

# Current Statues:
- Working (it wasn't before bc im a retard)
